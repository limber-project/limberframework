## Reporting bugs, features, & enhancements
This section guides you through submitting a bug report, feature request, or enhancement suggestion for the Limber Framework. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behaviour, and find related reports.

When you are creating a request, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

### Steps
When submitting a request, follow the steps below:

1. Review the issues under the [issues tab](https://github.com/limber-project/limber/issues) to see if it has already been reported;
2. Create a new issue, under the [issues tab](https://github.com/limber-project/limber/issues), selecting the appropriate template, completing the required information, and adding an appropriate label.

> If you find a 'Closed' issue that is similar to the issue you are submitting, create a new issue and include a link to the Closed issue.

The table below shows which template and label to select for each type of issue submission.

| Type        | Template        | Label       |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Bug         | Bug report      | bug         |
| Feature     | Feature request | feature     |
| Enhancement | Feature request | enhancement |

> If your issue does not match any of the types stated above, select 'Open a blank issue' and choose an appropriate label.

## Submitting pull requests
Follow the steps below for submitting changes to the Limber Framework:

1. Run the changes through pylint and resolve any issues;
2. Create a pull request, under the [pull request](https://github.com/limber-project/limber/pulls), setting the base to the develop branch and providing as much detail as possible.

> While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
