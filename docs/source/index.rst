Limber Framework Documentation
============================================

**Source Code**: https://github.com/limber-project/limberframework

Limber Framework is a python web application framework with the goal of simplifying the development of web applications.
It is based on the FastAPI framework and provides services to handle common tasks that are required by web applications.

The key features are:

* **Fast setup**: quickly setup a new project with many of the services available and configured out of the box.
* **Caching**: choose from a range of different caching options already implemented.
* **Authentication**: easily authenticate a request using different mechanisms.
* **Database**: get up and running fast with SQLAlchemy and Alembic setup out of the box.
* **Rate limiting**: protect your API with the throttling middleware.
